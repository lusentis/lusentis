#### About me

**CTO & Full-stack developer since 2012.** I love coding in Next.js, Typescript, and AWS (Serverless). I love bootstrapping projects and teams. I particularly enjoy the early stages of product building. I'm a co-organizer of Serverless Italy Meetup and ServerlessDays. During the weekends, I'm a timekeeper at national and international sports competitions.
